# TO DO
## In Progress
- Roll Functionality
	- ChatCommand for rolling
	- pin function doesn't work sometimes
	- neutral mod color change
	- type error when skill/attack doesn't exist
	- Add conditional additional rolls, to be executed on failure, on success
- GCA import

	- appearance
	- finish features
	- meta-traits

	- alternate abilities
 - PDF Support (done?)
 - GGA 0.15 integration
	- add posture to dynamic character
	- add maneuver to dynamic character
	- add non-attribute resource trackers to dynamic character (optional, could think of better solution)
	- add move modes to dynamic character
	- add move advantage parsing (by name? or feature? or VTT notes?) for "Flight", "Walk on Air".
	the names parsed should be customizable via an object-type system setting. the names(?) value should be an array of strings
	- add optional encumbrance to dynamic character
	- add deprecation/migration warning to static character
	- add deprecation warning to static items
