- Store the last targeted roll for every actor in the GURPS object (`GURPS.lastTargetedRolls`). Use the actor's or token's ID to fetch a data object with the results of that roll. This might be used in a macro to get and use margin of success, for example.

Example:

```js
let actor = game.actors.getName('Arne Arneson')
let data = GURPS.lastTargetedRolls[actor.id]
console.log(
  `check: [${data.thing}], modified target: [${data.finaltarget}], roll total: [${data.rtotal}], margin of success: [${data.margin}]`
)

- Fixed an issue with Western European style decimals (such as '6,25') in the Basic Speed field during imports. If the value contains a comma (',') character, it is parsed as if it is Western European; otherwise it is parsed as if it is US/UK ('6.25').
- More maneuver tweaks -- I think it really works correctly now.
- Implemented tight beam burning from B399. To use this, add the 'tbb' damage modifier with the 'burn' damage type (for example, `[6d burn tbb]`).
- Added portrait to NPC and NPC-CI actor sheets.
- Added Encumbrance, Move & Dodge and Lifting & Moving Things to Combat tab in the Tabbed Actor sheet.
